= Building Other Languages

== Overview

Enabling support for other languages is straightforward.  Currently
`thrift-nicejson` supports Python and ocaml.  To enable, just configure:

....
% ./configure <other args> --with-python=yes --with-ocaml=yes
....

Then `make all` and `make check` work as expected.  For each of these
languages, prerequisites must be installed.  Obviously, the Thrift
language-specific library must already have been built and installed.

=== Python Prerequisites

There are no specific Python prerequisites, but this library has only
been tested with Python version 2.7.12 on Ubuntu 16.04.1.

=== Ocaml Prerequisites

This library has been tested with the following required packages:

* Ocaml 4.04.2
* opam 1.2.2
* ocamlfind 1.7.3
* yojson 1.4.0
* ounit 2.0.6 (only for tests)
