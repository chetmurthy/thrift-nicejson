=== What's the difference between `TJSONProtocol` and `TNiceJSONProtocol` ?

`TJSONProtocol` is a JSON protocol in name only:

1. a Thrift IDL type like
....
struct Bar {
  1: required i32 a ,
  2: required string b,
}
....

with `a=32, b="foo"` produces a JSON like `{"1":32,"2":"foo"}`.  To
wit, the fields are _field-ids_, not _field-names_.  This makes the
JSON effectively unreadable and unwritable (to humans).  And
completely useless for interoperating with any other JSON-capable
system (b/c none of them use such a field-naming convention).

2.. It doesn't support any variation in the white-spacing of the JSON.

3. It doesn't produce correct JSON when applied to Thrift types like `map[list<i32>]string`.
