The author of most of this code is Chet Murthy.  But much of it is
based on examples from Apache Thrift, and it would be unfair to
characterize Chet Murthy as "the author", rather than simply an
"adapter" and "improver" upon Apache Thrift.

The file "json.hpp" was copied with permission from
[JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) created by
Neils Lohmann.  This thing is bloody lovely marvel.
